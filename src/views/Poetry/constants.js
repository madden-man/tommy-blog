`Alright = All Right

There was a man who loved the Lord
But bored of bread on Sundays
So soon he stored it in a hoard
Behind the chapel's stairway

His wife had seen him steal away
As many times as forty
So soon she prayed he'd eat his way
Back into heaven's glory.

The pastor was a dirty dude
That always stank of herring
But, smelling food, he thought it rude
That someone wasn't sharing!

They all were slaves to thoughts of sin
That THEY were in the right
But though they grin, and weep within,
To God they were alright.`,

  'although_some_friends':
`Although some friends abandon lonely way,
In every chilly day my eye is keen.
Though some vain promises may last a day,
Believe in me, that I'll protect my queen.
Humility has far too high a gaze
For simple men to look it in the face
Yet I’ll remain, with countenance unfazed
Providing honest comfort through the race.
Races never purify the soul,
Unless in every step you know your worth;
Valor oftentimes forgets to grow,
Unless you let your rain barrade the earth.
I'll never learn to love the winter night,
Yet for the sake of love I'll learn to fight.`,
  
  'a_poem_about':
`A Poem About Me

Time has a way of removing your pain
Just as a father condemning the weeds
But how do you find what is hidden inside
If never you're given a moment to breathe?

One man alone may have treasure inside
Hidden for none but his muscles to find
But when you awake and are turned from the lies
The truth makes you wonder where passion resides?

Hard work, for certain, can earn a man plenty
Many a man have learned that one by twenty
Luck has a way of not finding the guilty
But only when airwaves unseen start to glisten

I've watched a man go from brother to friend
I've seen a girl turn and forsake her land
I've grit my teeth in a cold barren wasteland
And I've been the one who confides in my waistband

But who, may I ask, is the judge of such actions?
Who of all creatures reigns over the pastures?
Sometimes I find that my words carry meaning
But softly and quickly that glimpse seems to trickle

Over and under, over and back
Watching the ladies preparing their tack
Where have the men gone with feet ever open?
Why is the spoonful of medicine broken?

Here I will sit, surely here shall I stay
Hoping that someone will catch him someday
If it were me, I would surely not listen
Those voices inside hardly care for an instant`,

  'black_to_blue':
`Black -> Blue

Black on black of holy shame
I have tried to swim in vain
Singing tunes about God's Name
While watching joy sink down the drain.

Lonely mountains know my pain
But ignore my wandering heart
For my mind must be insane
That I would relish Satan's darts.

Who have I been from the start?
A man of flesh and blood?
For every sea my staff must part
While stilled, still weeps a flood.

For many days I sat and prayed
That I would be a king,
But God, with all His where-with-all,
Instead taught me to sing.

His grace upon my shoulder
Was too lovely.

His love in every boulder
It's too much.

I can't even.

Blue to black and black to blue
Life an ever changing hue
In the night I paid my due
Now daylight breaks, and makes me new.`,

  'black_sunlight_shine':
`Black Sunlight, Shine!

There once was a girl made of sunshine
Who danced in black light with a grapevine
She went to build hope
In a city of dope,
And eloped with the Lord and His bloodline.

There once was a guy like a blacklight
Distinguishing sunshine from midnight
He went to be strong
And believe he belonged,
So along came the fire of birthright.

Then one day they met in a daydream
And decided to swim off the mainstream
They shared of their pain
(which was one and the same),
And became like two rays of a sunbeam.`,

  'callings':
`Callings

I felt a tug like silver
Dripping down my spine
And though I felt it quiver
I knew that light was mine

The call, its pound inside me
Too fierce to just ignore
My strength had stood so lonely
With no one to adore

So soon I found another
To kiss and call my own
Her blood, her thickest thunder
Became my golden throne

Her eyes flashed lightning courage
Her hair tossed faith like rain
So catching these, I flourished
And found my given name

I longed to linger longer
To make her lips my home
With each romantic saunter
My bones became like foam

The wind was blowing ceaselessly
The ocean's salty spray
The silence sang too tenderly
That truth would soon decay

I grabbed my hat and jacket
I kissed my love goodbye
My mouth, it made a racket
As normal went to die

My feet will take me upwards
Towards endless years of strife
But crumbling pride will suffer
Till death returns my life
Till death returns my life`,

  'colorado_love':
`Colorado Love

Colorado love…
Composed of thoughtless ecstasy?
Colorado love…
A world of color, bright or bleak?

One day a long long time ago
I smiled at God and said,
“Take me somewhere my heart's never been..”

He laughed and sang a lullaby,
To still my soul to sleep,
But in the wind I caught His eye,
And knew He’d lead His sheep.

Across the world the pages flew,
My life in black and white,
And people when they saw them knew
My balls were bold and bright.

The state was Colorado,
That land of mountain mares.
The sun was El Dorado
The earth was laissez faire.

I met the road with open arms,
I hugged my dad goodbye.
And then before I knew it
I was driving ‘cross the sky.

I sang my whole life story
Like a shot of Irish gin,
But no one heard the telling tale.
My thoughts were caged within.

I fin’lly found the hills I loved,
But something wasn’t right.
I couldn’t touch the sun above.
Or even smell her light.

Colorado love…
What makes these mountains bittersweet?
Colorado love…
Why do I wander through the street?

One day a long long time ago
I frowned at God and said,
“Help me find friends that make my heart sing.”

A week of work and I was swamped
With nothing too insightful.
Be smart, be kind, be fun, be prompt..
My mind a loaded rifle.

A nameless, sulking dread creeped in
And cursed my lonely heart
My grinning brimming sin within
Said, “Tear your soul apart.”

But God did not give up on me,
He let me feel His pain,
That every battle I’d jihad
Had driven me insane.

He told me honest of my past,
How lust made love turn gray,
And so, steadfast, my fast would last
Forever and a day.

I trusted in my Father,
Even when He broke my mind,
For He had brought me farther
And his truth was cold but kind.

Eventually I learned to find
A rhythm to my life.
My humbled heart was counted blind
And silence sang of strife.

Colorado love…
I thought my past was pure and sweet
Colorado love…
I'm always blind but now I see

One day a long long time ago
I looked at God and said,
“Cleanse my cold heart and help me believe..”

And then one day occurring
Like an apple pie in May,
I felt the Lord within me,
Those ghosts were kept at bay.

I'd driven out towards Boulder,
That place with rocks and trees,
But in the steel can holder,
There was no more room for me.

I drove back towards my unit,
But surprised I took a right,
And then before I knew it,
I was parking in delight!

I'd found a hidden treasure,
Where Jesus bought me time.
The wind blew through with pleasure,
The rain washed out my rhyme.

That day had brought me close to love,
So night brought opposition.
A Jewish man said, “Faith's a sham,”
But hope had brought conviction.

I told him, “Son, you haven't won,
See, Jesus’ heart was free
But as the stars sang broken bars,
He nailed it to a tree.”

I'd tarry long and tell the tale
Of each long, lovely day,
But then my poem, like Jeroboam,
Would never go away.

Basically I rode a plane
And flew on Aetna's dime,
And though my wallet seemed to wane,
My thoughts were flowing fine.

Colorado love…
I live with you and you with me
Colorado love…
You've made my soul your devotee

One day a long long time ago
I gazed at God and said,
“You fill my heart with unspoken things.”

I met a humble, happy group,
Who bribed me with some food,
And I could tell, and daresay smell,
Their hearts were pure and good.

A couple weeks went by like that!
I watched my armor thicken.
I worked all day, wrote apps by night,
And felt my manhood glisten.

I don't know when they felt like friends,
But suddenly they were -
My mama says it all depends
On who you would prefer

But never did I choose them!
And neither they choose me!
I guess that's how His family works
It's unconditionally.

No, never in my wildest dreams
Would I have thought this real.
And dreams I had, both strange and sad,
But family helped me heal.

I dreamed of old ex girlfriends,
And blood upon my hands,
I dreamed of angry dads offended
By my shifting sands.

I didn't even tell them how
My soul was lost in snow,
But still despite the heartbreak
They were making my heart glow.

By then the app was finished -
That is, done enough to share.
But still I kept on fighting
So that Slack would not compare.

Colorado love…
These people are like You and me
Colorado love…
When will You show me how to sleep?

One day a long long time ago
I sighed at God and said,
“My heart has died to what it can't be.”

Now, all this time I worked my ass
Like some long hated donkey
But as my muscles lifted brass
My vision went quite wonky.

I felt my inner soldier cry
To faithful God above,
“How can I from your Word imply
That two and two make love?”

He took me for a walk
And let me talk His time away,
But then with blades of elvish shade
We heard the green grass say,

“Guidance is a blessing
Of which man should not presume.
Don't try to keep on guessing God,
But let His Spirit bloom.”

That night I walked in darkness,
But His Word became my light.
And by the moon I found my way
When North felt more like night.

Another couple weeks went by
And friendships took on names.
Grantwon, Purple, Sunshine Ray
And Tank, the world's best train.

I thought my life complete and whole
Before they galloped in,
But now that family filled a hole
I'll miss them like my kin.

The lonely world had crushed my hope
And stifled my desire,
But God, instead of using soap
Has cleansed me with His fire.

Colorado love…
These angels are Your holy sheep
Colorado love…
Keep them strong, and keep them free

One day a long long time ago
I smiled with God and said,
“Lord, now my heart has finally found peace.”`,

'conjunctivitis':
`Conjunctivitis

Red and puffy my eye did swell
Soon my face was a wishing well
Drugs allowing the faintest hope
Healing comes at the hand of dope

Sure, the pain was a little strong!
Yeah, my prayers felt a little long!
But now in silence I share my pride
That through the midst of it I survived.`,
    
  'daydreams':
`Daydreams

In the falling of the night
When my eyes have lost their sight
I will hang on blackened light
Which cracks my lonely daydreams

Dreams and visions come to pass
Breaking hearts of men like glass
But I wonder what will last
As life expounds my daydreams

Heavy still my heart will fight
Taking all but love's first sight
Still denying it the right
Of pure and fruitless daydreams

Surely there is greener grass
But kaleidoscopes of glass
Brighten all but colored brass
Of cold and dainty daydreams`,
          
  'deep_deep_deep':
`Deep, Deep, Deep

Deep, deep under
My heart has fought his thunder
Will lightning not awake?
My darkest day..

Deep, deep without
My lungs would scream for drought
I drown in blackened wake
The cold of lonely lake

Deep, deep within
his words the shape of sin
he slithers like a snake
Wanders away..`,
   
  'greatness':
`Greatness

My heart could wrestle tyranny,
My brain could rack its shelves,
My feet could sprint there wearily,
But will we lose ourselves?

[Them] Through forests dark he delves.

I sense the promise making plans
Demanding strength and time
But while I wait with open hands
My eyes caress his rhyme...

[Them] Up mountains tall he climbs.

Will fate beat lonely, brazen gong?
Will tempers lose their men?
And in the chaos of the song
Will war be my amen?

[Them] He murders yet again.

He storms towards frozen avenues
He shouts his will of iron
And till he's lost his golden hue
He'll still pursue his siren.

His hands are mighty kryptonite
His lips sing scornful praise
His darkness seems like blinding light
Until its fire's ablaze.

He may have gorgeous women pray
To be his one and only
He may have priesthoods come and say
To him be all the glory

He may have riches stocked away
Inside his lonely circus,
But here I'll stay and rue the day
That Greatness be my purpose.`,
    
  'ghost_in_me':
`Great big rock of fiery terror
Look on me and smell my pain
For with every tearful sorrow
I forsake the ghost in me

Every silence whispers sonnets
Wakening the ghost in me
But my soul knows playful smiles
Like it loves the ghost in me

Who am I, who looks for passion?
What is he, who screams and wails?
Every lie becomes his fortress
Every truth will blacken death

Soon my waking eyes will see him
Then my soul may banish mayhem`,
    
  'heaven_isnt_celibate':
`heaven isn’t celibate
this i know is true.
when you say the hell of it
you know you mean it too.

love is like a lightbulb
screw it till it glows.
all i know is when i die
i’d like my allies close.`,
    
  'i_met_a':
`i met a girl who was wilder than dreams
She filled me up till I burst at the seams
Light had surrounded her, flying in beams
To bring me abundance of bread.

i met a girl who despised every day
That people would come try and take me away
Loyal, she fought for the music to play
To wake me from tyrants of dread.

i met a girl who pursued me with fire
Dancing, so regal, to trumpet and lyre
Never ashamed of her purest desire
To give me a new scarlet thread.

i know a girl whose blood has been shed
i know a girl who could never be dead`,
    
  'i_know_the_taste':
`I Know the Taste of Death

I know the taste of death.
I've slept in wind swept skin,
Letting fiery darkness in,
Forgiven kin.

I know the taste of death.

That broken icy dagger
Not plunged in heart, or soul, or chin,
But chilling your chest,
Leaning against
Your throat.
Righteousness.

I know the taste of death;
That beauty bittersweet of tongue,
Lamenting battles lost and won,
Enjoying empty breath.

I know the taste of death
And in it some have lost their way,
Veins of varicose delighted,
Crown of hollow gray.

But here I stand today.
Lungs still breathing, jawline set.
Hope yet fleeting, courage bent.
Firm in life made new by death.

I may know the taste of death,
But I will choose the breath God Lent,
Dancing with that sweet duet
And yet
Still, my darling, don't forget
Still, my love,
I will repent.`,
   
  'I_stood_alone':
`I stood alone on morning clear
Awaiting brighter days,
When suddenly from ages past
Came River Jordan’s gaze.

He slowly slithered toward me
With faith in God above
But as I searched my heart for Him
I felt not fond of love.

He said, “Son, see your sword so strong
And trust your tired toil,
From sea to sea you scrub your heart
Of tainted talent’s spoils.”

I wrestled there with fear’s desire
For insecurity,
Till what appeared but burning fire
Which stole my purity.

She said, “Seduced by brothel’s brood?
Man, you are not my first.
But bubbling blood can bribe my tongue
When apathy sings thirst.”

I wondered then what I must do
To free myself from pain,
But feeling naught save lost in thought
I ran away ashamed.

With tears I cried out longingly
For He who took my blame
But though He waited next to me
I barely knew His name.

In desperate plea and solemn stare
I turned to Him and said,
“I know Your love has no compare
But silence bites like bread.”

I listened for the whirling wind
And Spirit singing free,
But as belief still mourned in grief
My love became a tree.

It grew and grew in morning dew
Till it could lead the way
Then showed me who I wanted to
Become through darkest days.

“I live with you and heard your cry
As desperately you died
But now it’s clear through wasted tears
That I have found my bride.”

No longer shall I wait in vain
For miracles of youth,
But now I stand with hand in hand
And pray for simple truth.`,
    
  'i_will_not':
`I will not bow to the mountains
Or worship the bull's grassy plain;
Heartstains may cover the ocean,
But still there my spirit refrains.
I will not conquer the city
Or kill with the kindest intent;
Though my soul drowns in its tearstains,
My spirit in stillness repents.
He has accomplished my nightmare
When sorrow was borrowed in Love;
He has relinquished His Spirit,
He has become like a dove.
I have done nothing but watch Him alight;
Now I will follow Him, dancing in flight.`,

'In_your_eyes':
`In your eyes resides a home
Far from fear and scars of old
Shoulders formed of modest gold,
Spread your wings of liquid chrome

In your skin I find my love
Wrapped in passion like a glove
Hairs of rain and wildfire,
Cleanse my every vain desire

In your hands is life and death
Restless beauty born of Eve
Humble chest so full of breath,
Sing for all that you believe

In your soul is bone of bone
In your heart is flesh of flesh`,

  'journeys':
`We laughed a lot tonight
Rejoicing with the sound
Our brave old hearts could fight
The music or the ground

Instead we travel on
Till dawn and dusk depart
And let the moon and stars
Declare we are apart

There is no fear in death
When lengthy words have died
For in life's every breath
Comes love's renewing tide.`,

  'my_greatest_fear':
`My Greatest Fear

I do not fear Destruction’s banal game,
Though battles steal my every wisdom tooth;
The people’s hearts, they scream I am uncouth,
Yet my chagrin lies not in taking blame.
I do not fear the wild lusts of youth,
Which seek to bring my sturdy heart to shame,
Nor shouts of hate which bring me backwards fame,
So look me in the eye and see my weary truth.
Demons come and torment in the night,
But darkness casts no shadow over light;
Purity dissolves in empty fright,
But Death is suicidal in his plight.
No, greatest fears should lie in Love itself,
Which fiercely finds its way off lonely shelf.`,
  
  'no_matter_what':
`No Matter What

Every line of crack that man may sneeze
Every word of jack that man may breathe
Every change in tack that man may grieve
Woman, believe, no matter what.

Every empty word that woman lies
Every tear absurd that woman cries
Every useless girdle woman buys
Man, let her rise, no matter what.

Many chances human frailty wastes
Many fountains human tongues may taste
Many seasons human love feels chaste
Love, come with haste, no matter what.

When you feel cut, or in a rut,
What is your no matter what?`,

  'natures_hue':
`Nature's hue and morning dew
Spells wonder and amazement,
But magic fades from crystal rain
And earth turns into pavement.

Greenish golds and blues are bright,
Correcting me towards greatness,
But children smell, and never tell,
That regal thoughts are tasteless.

What kind of love can strangers bear?
What kind of hope would sway me?
But through the lies I've found the wise
And of the earth they daydream.`,
    
  'slack_line_love':
`Slack Line Love

Love is like a slack line
Bouncing up and down
I look like a clown
Falling to the ground

Love is like a slack line
Listen to the vine
Heart will learn to shine
Blood will taste like wine

Love is like a slack line
Feel your courage grow
Life can seem to glow
This I've come to know

That Love is like a slack line
Across the Berlin Wall
Only twelve feet tall..
For once I shall not fall.`,

  'the_Lord_is':
`The Lord is my home,
My rest in dark places.
The world can be crowded
With cruelly blank faces.
In youth I would wander
And search for a nest,
But now that I've found Him
His strength is my rest.

The Lord is my rock,
He's there when I'm low.
Sometimes it feels like
I'm drowning in snow.
When long words are empty
And patience wears thin,
He listens so deeply
That warmth spreads within.

The Lord is my Shepherd,
I trust in His word.
The voices inside me
Make truth seem absurd.
But bygones be bygones,
I come when I'm called,
For Love and His whispers
Have given me all.`,
  
  'the_Lords_will':
`The Lord’s Will

The Lord will be our shepherd,
That’s the only thing I know.
Despite our shame, our fear and pain,
You best believe we’ll grow.

We’ll dig our roots in very deep
Towards Pangea’s core,
Then listen, gently, for the sound
Of Jesus at the door.

We’ll stretch our branches heavenward
Providing holy shade,
So people come and gather round
To sing of mem’ries made.

With every fiber in our soul,
The Lord will make our spirit whole.`,

  'the_quiet_truth':
`The Quiet Truth

When sunlight blazes brighter
than a lightning bolt in May,

The truth is waiting with you,
no matter what you say.

When rain beats down upon your town
and forces you to flee,

Believe and trust in God's true love,
for Jesus' words are free.

No matter what the circumstance,
no matter rain or shine,

Hope will reign through all my days,
and Yahweh's life is mine.`,

  'theres_nothing_i':
`There's nothing I can say,
There's nothing I can do.
I'm a thousand miles away today
So please, my Lord, come through.
If I could shoot the moon and make
Her joy come out and sing,
Then like a humble raindrop
Lunar worlds would fall and bring
Heaven down, a world of sound,
And happy dances too,
But here I wait and trust the Lord
That He is here for you.
There's nothing I can say,
There's nothing I can do.`,

  'watchman_o_watchman':
`Watchman, O Watchman (Isaiah 21)

Watchman, O Watchman
Sing me a song
Rather than trying
To stay up too long
Night turned to day
And the blackness of light
So here I will stay
In my conquest of sight.

Watchman, O Watchman
Tell me a tale
Of some foreign wasteland
Where corpses still stare
Day turned to night
And the mice ran away
But still I will fight
To recover the day.

Watchman, O Watchman
Wait for a while
I will be back
With a glance and a smile.
Soon I will ask him
What's left of the night
And know that his answer
Is sweet, dark, and bright.

No longer ruled by the day or the night.`,

  'what_can_right':
`What Can Right Ten Thousand Wrongs?

What can right ten thousand wrongs?
Oh, not I, the farthest gone.
Pride has taught me for so long,
Shameless teaching hate.
I wait to sing my song.

I entered through the wide gate
Battled without breastplate
Trusting in my own fate
And willing to offend.
I sinned, and that holds weight.

Audrey, you were my friend
You trusted that I’d defend
And though I didn’t intend
To stab your back so deep..
I guess that’s just my trend.

My guilt, I feel it seep
My body yearns to weep
But calloused hearts don’t keep
Their promises so well.

I guess it’s hard to tell.

I wrote this poem because...
I guess I didn’t know how else to tell you how sorry I am.
I didn’t realize how
completely
I betrayed you so long ago until Priscella talked to me tonight..
But when I told Zach about you liking him..
That’s exactly what I was doing.
No excuses.
I’m the kind of person that can get caught up in emotion..
That forgets other people’s needs because I am so focused on
‘living in the moment’ or
‘finding myself’ or
whatever self-centered thing I’m focused on at the time.

It’s not really just that, though, is it?
Because I’ve treated you like shit for about two months now.
I don’t know why I talked to you,
of all people,
the way I did..
Hate is truly pointless, after all..
But when I spoke to you,
it wasn’t with words of love,
however much I try to convince myself that it was.
Even though I would’ve held my tongue for anyone else, I didn’t for you..
And I’m so, so sorry for that.
You were my excuse for being evil,
and my outlet for the stress in my life.

But because I had gotten so used to being that way when I was around you..
I guess I stopped noticing.
We worked our jobs at Saferide and
didn’t look each other in the eye and
assumed everything would be alright as soon as we could get away from each other.
But it wasn’t alright,
at least, it wasn’t alright with me.
Hate was standing between us,
the kind of hate that deceives you into thinking it’s real
but really grows out of the seductive,
underlying bitterness my callous words had inspired in your heart.
And though I began to fight it a few weeks ago,
I’ve been losing.

So now..
I’m not gonna expect you to be my friend again.
I get it.
Even though I would swear on my life not to do it again,
I’m broken and foolish and I don’t want you to get hurt anymore.
I’m not being overdramatic.
I know myself and now I know how deeply I hurt you.

This letter does have a purpose, though.
I need you to forgive me.
Not for my sake,
certainly not,
but for the sake of your heart.
I don’t want to see you get lost in the same
despair and depression
that I was caught up in for so long last semester,
invoked by a annoyance so tiny and bitter that
it has the power to eat up everything in you.
I’m not just preaching...
It’s true.
And I don’t want you to lose yourself in hating anyone,
even me.

that’s my spiel. hope you liked it.

  'will_you_care':
  `When all the world felt dark as night,
  My love, you weren’t there.
  
  When hurricanes came cold and bright,
  Your world was cool and fair.
  
  When hidden thoughts were brought to light,
  You didn’t let me share.
  
  When angry spirits fought to fight,
  You didn’t shoot a prayer.
  
  When I was told by grinning eyes
  That I’m no Israelite,
  My tear ducts dried at all her lies
  While you went to the fair.
  
  When I was lost on mountain slopes,
  With no one left in sight,
  My compass lost its soggy hopes
  But you put up no flare.
  
  When I was cursed by bitter drink,
  Which paralyzed my might,
  My heart was choked by chakra-sink,
  While you played solitaire.
  
  Despite the bright, nostalgic fight,
  My words are quite unfair,
  For though my plight was filled with fright,
  My love was unaware.
  
  Your face was mine a moon ago,
  Our necks, our knees unknown,
  And baggage lines up out the door
  Like demons not outgrown.
  
  You hide behind your hair
  And long to satisfy your pain.
  But no, I haven’t understood
  Your storms of wind and rain.
  
  Your soul is less than white,
  And mine has wear and tear,
  
  But nonetheless, I swear.
  
  When you don’t care,
  When you’re squared up with bears
  And the air just stares at your despair,
  When nightmares compare with the warfare of your life
  And you’re ensnared in your own welfare, impaired beyond repair,
  To the last threadbare moment, yes, I swear to declare with every ounce of flair left,
  
  I will fight for you.
  
  When my knuckles whiten from writing my delight for you,
  Will you fight for me?
  
  When my appetite excites and I invite myself into you,
  Will you fight for me?
  
  When my hatred ignites and reveals outright that I am not you,
  Will you fight for me?
  
  When I’m not all there,
  Will you care?`,

'When_violence_refuses':
`When violence refuses to be named,
Resisting every torrent of the truth,
Your faith will have no fear of the untamed,
For ransomed courage leads to endless youth.
You see, the world in such a different way
Corrupts the purest love and clean desire,
But faith is not dependent on the day
And man, he has no power over fire.
The world has no more knowledge of the cross
Than silver feet that aimless run a race,
But gentle love will triumph over loss
Once God reveals His purpose, and His face.
No force of hell can quench undying beauty,
So you, dear friend, are safe from death’s cruel duty.`,

`Why I Stray

Every night I go to sleep
With demon pussy sinking deep.
You see, I've learned expectantly
That in my sea of broken dreams
The faintest joy and blindest hope
Are weepy, weaker than they seem.
If I see sin as cancer
She excites the tumors deeper.
If I give in to failure,
She defeats me as a dancer.
Her name is Lovely Lust and man,
Her bust is big and blooming.
Sometimes her breasts are discontent
Like eyes that go perusing.
But I don't mind, she fills the time,
I fill her inner places.
I say, it's fine if no one sees
My friction fuck your faces.
At night she comes in widowed shame,
How could I make her go?
She's destitute, no pride, no loot,
Why not make this her home?
But there's another living there
A Girl I love like lightning.
With Her that joy and hope is left
To sulk and moan that they're bereft
Of me, the king of inward realm.
I choose who lives and dies!
So when I let her take the helm,
I'm living in her lies.
My Girl, the one who listens close,
When all is dark in grey morose
Would boast of me if I would choose
To love her wine instead of booze;
Speckled like a butterfly, my love
Is beauty, sure,
But what of lust? I will, I must
Forsake my whore.

After all, her dusty rust
Is like a lioness.
I watch her stalk her evening prey
And cum between her teeth.
Now - today! Don't let her lay
Upon your ivory tower.
Unless perhaps she hints
That you could watch her in the shower..
No! How could I be so dumb?
Am I so numb to fire?
I cannot see a way that I
Could choose what I hold dear.
With lust, I feel so lonely..
With love, I know true fear.

Fear?
Is that the root of this?
My old, forgotten friend?
Fear!
Your fangs of folly hiss.
Destruction is your trend!
Fear.
Emotion far from bliss,
Perspectives pulled and bent,
Fear
Is cast away by love,
Why do I self-pretend?

Love?
My Girl, am I the same?
She must have gone away.
Love!
She calls my middle name
She waited out the gray..
Love.
Her beauty's brightest flame
I come and hear her say...
Love
Is stronger than you(r) fear,
So know, I'll always stay.`,
          
  'Your_hair_is':
`Your hair is crimson mockingbird,
Your eyes are home to fire;
Your smile evicts man's loneliness
And stifles hate’s desire.

Your teeth are winter wonderland,
Your hands as cold as ice;
Your voice can sing a playful tune
Or shout of humor’s price.

Your faith is timeless as the sea,
Your courage fights what's mild;
Your love is warm as summer day
And gently tames my wild.

Your face is fair, beyond compare, but faces are a bore --
Your beauty rests in humble quest to live with hope restored.`,
